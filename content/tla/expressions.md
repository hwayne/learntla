We've been implicitly using _expressions_ up until now; we just haven't clarified them. For our purposes, an expression is __anything that follows a `==`, `=`, `:=`, or `\in`__. In this section we'll cover some general expression modifiers.

### Logical Junctions

We've used these for a while now: `/\` is and, `\/` is or. We can join expressions with them. The one subtlety is that this is the _only_ case where TLA+ is whitespace sensitive. If you start a line with an indented junction, TLA+ considers that the start of a subclause. For example,

```tla
/\ TRUE
  \/ TRUE
/\ FALSE \* (T \/ T) /\ F

/\ TRUE
  \/ TRUE
  \/ FALSE \* (T /\ (T \/ F))

\/ TRUE
\/ TRUE
  /\ FALSE \* T \/ (T /\ F)
```

Etc. As a general rule of thumb:

* If two logical operators are on the same level of indentation, they are part of the same level of expression.
* If a logical operator is on a higher level of indentation, it's part of the previous operator statement.
* Use only one type of operator per level of indentation.

Generally if you mess this up the spec will crash, so you're unlikely to get a logic bug through this.

### LET-IN

Any expression can use LET-IN to add local operators and definitions to just that expression alone.

```tla
LET IsEven(x) == x % 2 = 0
IN  IsEven(5)

LET IsEven(x) == x % 2 = 0
    Five == 5
IN  IsEven(Five)

LET IsEven(x) == LET Zero == 2
                 IN  x % Zero = Zero
    Five == 5
IN  IsEven(Five)
```

The whitespace does not matter: we can write `LET IsEven(x) == x % 2 = 0 Five == 5 IN IsEven(Five)` and it will correctly parse it as two separate operators in the LET. You should use newlines though, because you care about legibility.

### IF-THEN-ELSE

This is exactly what you expect it to be.

```tla
IsEven(x) == IF x % 2 = 0 
             THEN TRUE
             ELSE FALSE
```

As before, alignment doesn't matter, but you should align them anyway unless you really hate your coworkers.

### CASE 

Case is _mostly_ how you'd expect it to act, with one subtle difference.

```tla
CASE x = 1 -> TRUE
  [] x = 2 -> TRUE
  [] x = 3 -> 7
  [] OTHER -> FALSE
```

OTHER is the default. If none of the cases match and you leave out an OTHER, TLC considers that an error. If _more than one match_, though, TLC will pick one for you and _not_ branch. In other words, the following code

```tla
CASE TRUE -> FALSE
  [] TRUE -> TRUE
```

_May or may not be true._ Be careful.

## Nesting

All parts of expressions are expressions or identifiers, so you can put expressions inside other expressions. Additionally, all expressions can be used inside PlusCal code.
