This is the source code used to build the site [Learn TLA+](http://www.learntla.com). The guide is aimed at beginners to formal method who want to use it for simple (but useful!) specifications. "Making sure your email job doesn't spam everyone", not "Keep the spaceship from exploding".

### Setup

1. Clone repo
2. Get [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
3. Run with `hugo server` (on port 1313)
4. Either set up my [sad depressing Pygments plugin](https://github.com/hwayne/tla-pygments) or set `PygmentsCodeFences` to false in `config.toml`
